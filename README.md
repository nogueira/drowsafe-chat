## Overview

DrowSAFE is an open-source, fully offline driver drowsiness detection system that runs entirely on a **Raspberry Pi 5**. It uses a camera to monitor the driver's face in real time and detects early signs of fatigue — prolonged eye closure, excessive blinking, yawning, and head nodding — then triggers audible and visual alerts before an accident can happen.

No cloud. No subscription. No internet required. Just edge AI running at the dashboard of any vehicle.

## Hardware

| Component | Model | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SBC | Raspberry Pi 5 4GB | Main compute unit |
| Camera | Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 NoIR 12MP | No IR cut filter — works in low light |
| Display | Raspberry Pi Touch Display v1.1 7" | DSI connection, shows dashboard UI |
| Buzzer | Active piezo buzzer | GPIO-driven alert |
| Cable | RPi Camera Cable Standard→Mini 300mm | Required for Pi 5 mini CSI port |

## How It Works

DrowSAFE runs a continuous detection pipeline on the Pi 5 at ~30 fps:

```
Camera Frame
    │
    ▼
MediaPipe Face Mesh  ──►  468 facial landmarks
    │
    ▼
Feature Extraction
    ├── EAR  (Eye Aspect Ratio)       — detects eye closure / blinks
    ├── MAR  (Mouth Aspect Ratio)     — detects yawning
    └── Head Pose (PnP solve)         — detects forward head nod
    │
    ▼
Fatigue Scoring
    └── PERCLOS (% eye closure / 60s rolling window)
    │
    ▼
Alert State Machine
    ├── Level 0 — Alert    (green)
    ├── Level 1 — Warning  (amber)  → soft beep
    └── Level 2 — Critical (red)    → sustained alarm
    │
    ▼
Dashboard UI  +  GPIO Buzzer
```

All processing is **on-device**. No data leaves the vehicle.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/drowsafe.git
cd drowsafe
```

### 2. Run the setup script (first time only)

```bash
bash scripts/setup_drowsafe.sh
```

This installs all system and Python dependencies and creates the virtual environment.

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Launch DrowSAFE

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

Or directly:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Run the guided calibration flow:

```bash
python src/main.py --guided-calibration
```

This walks the driver through neutral face, eye closure, mouth opening, and
head nod samples, then saves recommended thresholds to `logs/calibration_*.json`.

---

## Configuration

All thresholds are in `config/config.py`. Key parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `EAR_THRESHOLD` | 0.13 | Eye aspect ratio below this = closed |
| `MAR_THRESHOLD` | 0.45 | Mouth aspect ratio above this = yawning |
| `PERCLOS_THRESHOLD` | 0.15 | >15% eye closure per minute = drowsy |
| `WARNING_SCORE` | 40 | Fatigue score to trigger level 1 alert |
| `CRITICAL_SCORE` | 70 | Fatigue score to trigger level 2 alert |
| `FRAME_WIDTH/HEIGHT` | 1280×720 | Camera capture resolution |
| `PROCESS_WIDTH/HEIGHT` | 640×360 | MediaPipe inference resolution |

See `docs/CALIBRATION.md` for guidance on tuning these to your face and lighting conditions.

### Raspberry Pi 5 performance profile

The default runtime is tuned for Pi 5 latency:

- Camera capture stays at `1280×720` for a clean dashboard feed.
- FaceMesh inference runs at `640×360` via `PROCESS_WIDTH/HEIGHT`.
- `DETECTOR_REFINE_LANDMARKS = False` disables iris refinement, which is not needed for EAR/MAR/head-pose scoring.
- `CAMERA_BUFFER_COUNT = 2` reduces capture latency with picamera2.
- OpenCV/native thread limits reduce CPU oversubscription.

For maximum FPS, set `SHOW_LANDMARKS = False` in `config/config.py`; drawing the full FaceMesh tessellation is useful for debugging but expensive.

### Product features

- Startup self-test checks camera, FaceMesh, dashboard, buzzer, and event logging.
- Alert banners include the main reason, such as `Eyes closed`, `Yawning detected`, `Head nod detected`, or `Face or camera unavailable`.
- Trip summaries are saved to `logs/trip_summary_*.txt` on shutdown, alongside the event CSV.
- Guided calibration saves personalised threshold recommendations for each installation or driver.

## GPIO Wiring

See `docs/WIRING.md` for the full buzzer wiring diagram.

Quick reference:
- Buzzer **+** → GPIO 18 (BCM)
- Buzzer **−** → GND
